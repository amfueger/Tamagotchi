Hi! 

My name is Ashley and this is my Tamagotchi game. Tamagotchi was a small, handheld game that was popular in my youth for a brief moment in time. It was a simple egg-like shell that housed a small 8-bit style screen with no color that allowed you to hatch and take care of a creature. The tamagotchi required that you feed it, play with it, ensure it slept and clean up after its messes. If you did not do these things, the tamagotchi would get increasingly upset and usually die. 

I have made a tamagotchi game where you can do generally these same things. You start with a baby tamagotchi, and when it turns 3 it evolves into an adult, and when it turns 6 it turns into a full grown tamagotchi before it passes away at age 10. 

The tamagotchi needs feeding, playing and sleep in order to keep it happy. This is measured out of 10, where the counter for its hunger, boredom and sleepiness starts at 0 and moves up in an interval to a limit of 10. If any of these metrics reach 10, the tamagotchi will die. 

Victory occurs when your tamagotchi reaches age 10 without dying of hunger, sleepiness or boredom.
